=== "‚ù§Ô∏è Private"

    - üìà**Personal development & Life**
        - **Sports**
            - **Calisthenics (Strength)** at home with programm from [Calisthenics Movement](https://www.calimove.com/p/complete-calisthenics-level-1-5) - highly recommended
            - **Yoga (Mobility)** with [down dog](https://www.downdogapp.com/) - ideally short daily session
            - **Gymnastics/Tricking (Cardio/Skill)** as long term member of [Free Arts of Movement "FAM"](https://www.freeartsofmovement.com/)
        - **Habits & Goals**
            - I strongly believe that building good [***"atomic"* habits/systems**](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) is key for personal development
            - Longer term I formulate goals in the 3 main areas **"Physical/Mental Health", "Social/Romantic Relationships" and "Career/Business"** along with habits and measures to reach them
        - **Learning/knowledge building**
            - To ensure I also can continously build upon and not forget from things I learn and experience in life also in my personal life, I like to maintain a [**second brain**](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) with [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
            - The Markdown syntax/files I use there help me **focus on writing stuff down quickly, interconnecting knowledge and also easily share** it e.g. on this site, which is also Markdown driven via [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
            - I recommend **summary services** like [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/) to quickly learn the core ideas from many books (also on the go)
            - [**Spaced Repitition**](https://ncase.me/remember/) is another proven method that many maybe barely memember when learning foreign language vocabulary in school, but to this day is a both effective and efficient method that's also e.g. supported by [plubins for Obsidian.md](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition): I even apply it to tracking habits, so I don't have to track them daily but only get reminded in increasing intervals given on how well I perform
        - **Financial**
            - I wouldn't call myself a frugalist, but I **value time and freedom** much more over e.g. a nice flat and expensive vacations and rather save up so that I can afford to e.g. work part-time, take sabattical and also not work till pension age as an employee but spend more time on personal projects, businesses and development instead
            - I think there's no real solution to the implications of the demographic change for pensions in developed countries and thus there's no way around investing heavily in a **private pension**
            - IMO, **passive investing** is the only sane, practical, time/cost efficent and not to mention scientifically proven effective investing method and I highly recommend (Souver√§n investieren)[https://www.amazon.de/Souver%C3%A4n-investieren-Indexfonds-ETFs-Book/dp/3593508524] from [Gerd Kommer](https://gerd-kommer.de/) and his ETF-based [globally diversified portfolio](https://www.justetf.com/en/academy/how-to-get-a-globally-diversified-portfolio-with-just-one-etf.html) approach
        - **Psychology**
            - interests me as I find it **fascinating how little one usually understands about how his/her own brain works** and thus how much can be learned and gained by a deeper understanding
            - my **favorite practises and concepts** here: 
                - [non-judgemental mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Now) / meditation / ignoring "monkey brain"
                - positive reinforcement via [lofty questions](https://blog.mindvalley.com/lofty-questions/) and future self/goal visualization
                - happiness through exercising, healthy eating and sleep as well, practising gratitude and investing in relationships
                - carrots and sticks for habits & commitment devices as well as momentum effect & getting started effect
                <!-- - planning fallacy (especially in IT...) -->
                - affect heuristic & making emotional/angry dicisions or e.g. impulse buying & buy month later rule
                - (anticipatory) loss aversion e.g. in dating & sunk cost fallacy, especially in investing
                <!-- - endowment effect e.g. liking your own cooking to unreasonable extend & not inveted here syndrom -->
                <!-- - peak-end rule: the ending experience is crucial -->
                <!-- - barnum effect & cold reading  -->
                <!-- - compromise "middle choice" effect -->
                <!-- - system 1|2 or fast|slow brain: understanding what we decide/do (un)consciously  -->
                - choice-supportive bias & being happy with (quick) choices
                - confirmation bias, bias blind spot ("I'm the least biased"), fundamental attribution error (personal rather than situational) and thus giving second chances and staying open for other points of view
                <!-- - social proof -->
                <!-- - lucid dreaming / dream journaling -->
    - üé≤**Tech & Fun**
        - **Audio**
            - proud owner of 2.1 setup from [Eve Audio Speakers](https://eve-audio.com/index.php?page=SC305) and more headphones than my flat has rooms
            - one of my favorite headphones are my [Koss Porta Pros](https://koss.com/products/porta-pro) with bluetooth mod, which also serve as warming ear pads in the winter 
            - owning a MIDI keyboard, Kalimba and Steel Tongue Drum with zero skill in all of them
            - collection of VU meters, cause I like the idea of lights synced to music
        - **Board games**: owning >100 board games, only got to play about half of them so far :D
        - **Video games**
            - nowadays I enjoy the never ending technical and broad artistic challenges of (2D) **video game creation** with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) often more than actually playing games
            - as **great inspiration for my game-dev journey** I want to mention [Cave Story](https://www.cavestory.org/) - a free (ü§Ø) 2D metroidvania made solo by the dev "Pixel" and IMO all around a masterpiece in every category from art style over music to story and gameplay
            - I still like to play old games e.g. from [myabandonware.com](https://www.myabandonware.com/) or newer **retro and/or indie** games for the nostalgic feeling and inspiration
        - **Park games**: from Badminton or Speedball, over Frisbee to Kubb or M√∂lkky
        - **Escape games**: IRL or as board games
    - üõ†Ô∏è**DIY**
        - **Electronics & (light) engineering**
            - energy: power banks and supplies, solar
            - smart home: mostly LED lighting and sensor/measurement e.g. for air quality
            - eletric tools: e.g. for drilling, heating, cutting, fans
            - audio & video, e.g. a DIY around-the-head POV cam
            - proud of my bedsize mounted TV on a flex arm
        - **Repairing** anything from household appliances over clothes to plumbing
        - **Artsy stuff**, like small wooden/metal jewlery or lamps
        - **Furnitue making & home improvement**
            - I like to combine light wood with black metal in funiture and green artifical plants and light/white/teal surfaces and linen in the environment for a kind of "carribian light industrial" style
            - most of my furnite is self-made or at least altered - quite proud about my DIY main desk, bed and steel-rod shelves/wardrobe
            - my floor is currently artifical grass :D
            - highly recommended: [SketchUp free](https://www.sketchup.com/de/plans-and-pricing/sketchup-free)
            - in the winter I enjoy my DIY infrared sauna
        - **Food & Cooking**
            - neither vegan nor vegetarian by conviction, but with **heathliness as a primary principle** I still eat mostly (steamed) veggies
            - because I like to maintain a lean physique, I somewhat regret having learned how to cook properly and make anything taste good ü•≤
            - I highly recommend buying **good spices** online in bulk (e.g. [W√ºrzteufel](https://wuerzteufel.de/)) - it's ultimately cheaper, tastier and e.g. healthier than using lots of salt
            - I like to do **intermittent fasting** cause I simply like eating good food to much and it also improves my sleep
            - IMO having good DIY pizza, sushi, burritos and salad skills is a nice asset for **bring-your-own-ingredients parties**
            - due to my **addiciton to sweet stuff**, I invested a lot of research, trial and error into **making DIY cakes, sweet and especially ice cream** with a fraction of their usual amounts of sugar, fat and calories in general - so now I can eat lots dailys and stay fit üòÖ
