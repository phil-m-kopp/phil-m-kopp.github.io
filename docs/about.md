        - **Video games**: nowadays I enjoy the never-ending technical and broad artistic challenges of (2D) **video game creation** with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) often more than actually playing games. Though I still like to play old games e.g. from [myabandonware.com](https://www.myabandonware.com/)/[gog.com](https://www.gog.com/) or newer **retro and/or indie** games for the nostalgic feeling and inspiration that either challenge my **reaction/dexterity** via action or thinking in turn-based **strategy**
        - **Physical Games**: from >100 board games, park games from Speedball over Frisbee to Kubb or Mölkky as well as escape games with friends - I like to **experience and analyze game mechanics** in all shapes and forms
    - 🛠️**DIY**
        - **Electronics & (light) engineering**: e.g. power banks & solar stuff, smart home sensors, small electric tools like drills, wearable cameras for action recording, folding bedside TV...
        - **Repairing** anything from household appliances over clothes to plumbing
        - **Artsy stuff**, like small wooden/metal jewelry or lamps
        - **Furniture making & home improvement**: I like to combine light wood and linen, black metal and artificial plants (even my indoor floor is artificial grass :D). Highly recommended: [SketchUp free](https://www.sketchup.com/de/plans-and-pricing/sketchup-free)
        - **Food & Cooking**, like to experiment in the direction of **molecular gastronomy**, also practising **intermittent fasting**; addicted to **sweet stuff**, thus e.g. making lots of DIY ice cream
