        - **Video games**: nowadays I enjoy the never ending technical and broad artistic challenges of (2D) **video game creation** with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) often more than actually playing games. Though I still like to play old games e.g. from [myabandonware.com](https://www.myabandonware.com/) or newer **retro and/or indie** games for the nostalgic feeling and inspiration that either challenge my **reaction/dexterity** via action or thinking in turn-based **strategy**

        - **Food & Cooking**, like to experiment in the direction of **molecular gastronomy**, also practising **intermittent fasting**; addicted to **sweet stuff**, thus e.g. making lots of DIY ice cream
