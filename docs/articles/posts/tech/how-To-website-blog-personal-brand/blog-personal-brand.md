==Define your niche==

Social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, or Stack Overflow can help you connect with other software developers, potential clients, employers, or partners, as well as showcase your portfolio, blog, podcast, or open source contributions. You can also use social media to share your thoughts, ideas, questions, or resources on software development, as well as to join relevant groups, communities, or discussions.

The best way to stand out is to create and share content. You don't need to be an expert to do that. You can begin by sharing questions, ideas or your journey from where you are to where you want to be.
