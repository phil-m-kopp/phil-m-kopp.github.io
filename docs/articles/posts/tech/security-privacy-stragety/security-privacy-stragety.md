## Dangers of neglecting tech security & privacy

### Security
- direct theft of money
- identity theft
  - invoicing purchases to you
  - decreased credit rating
  - account access frozen (payment, other services...)
  - reputational damage
    - crime in ones name
    - sensitive data leaks
    - private professional brand/trust damage
  - exhausting legal battles & doxing/harassment
  - feeling of violation & living in anxiety of attacks yet to happen
- legal (compliance) consequences in case of major neglect
- blackmail & ransom attacks

### Privacy
- contract rejection (medical records, car accidents...)
- deepfake attacks on family
- burglary, cyberstalking etc.

## Security & privacy in general

### Compartmentalization

- separating data of any kind for different purposes, e.g.
  - work/job
  - personal professional (e.g. personal brand, business, LinkedIn)
  - personal private (e.g. family and friends)
  - personal public (e.g. social, dating, shopping)
  - perosnal sensitive (e.g. health, finance, civil)
- when/where? can be done in most areas, from email over user profiles to even addresses
- benefits
  - organization
  - security: isolation
  - privacy: limiting the potentially exponential value increase of correlating your data across situations

### Pseudonyms

- your "alter egos" for different situations, though one is sufficient for most cases/people
- pseudonym should have own set of all data typically required for registration/contact purposes
  - address
  - birthday
  - phone
  - email
  - credit card
- depending on situation the contact data can be entirely fake or actually forward to you anonymously
- proving plausible fake information has benefit of
  - drawing less attention/suspicion than outright hiding data
  - making profiling harder by producing incoherent data

### Data cleanup

- When in doubt consider that the internet never forgets
- non-EU and especially are noticably more clingy with your data
- Overwriting (sensitive) data with junk is better than removal in many cases
  - given it's often legally sufficient to mark data as "deactivated" rathen then deleting it 
- [Ingocni](https://incogni.com/)
  - maybe try for 1 month for 80% of effect
- [JustDeleteMe](https://justdeleteme.xyz/)
  - check before account creation how "clingy" the company is

### US vs EU: paid options vs laws

- US has more advanced privacy service like [MySudo](https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/)
  - EU has stronger privacy laws that make
    - fewer options less of an issue
    - more extreme methods like SIMless phone less necessary

## Security & privacy per topic

### Address/post

To consider
- legal requirements for a physical address ("ladungsfähig") in certain cases like business mail

#### Services

[**"Postfach"** by Deutsche Post](https://www.deutschepost.de/de/p/postfach.html)
- ~30€/y
- provides anonymous "Postfach" address, but your real name is still needed
- forked routing to home address for private mail and Postfach for e.g. business mail possible
- not a physical address in the legal sense
- doesn't work for packages

**Packing stations**
- free!
- e.g. from [DHL](https://www.dhl.de/de/privatkunden/pakete-empfangen/an-einem-abholort-empfangen/packstation/empfangen-packstation.html), UPS, Amazon Locker
- provides anonymous address, but your real name is still needed

**Imprint services**
- ~5-20€/m
- e.g. https://www.autorenservices.de/impressums-service/
- provide a physical address to satisfy legal requirements e.g. for own blog or business
  - where you could otherwise be fined for not putting your home address publicly on the internet
- mail forwarding usually costs extra and packages usually not possible

**Scan and forwarding services**
- ~10-40€/m
- e.g. [Clevver](https://www.clevver.io/de/produkte/clevvermail-postdigitalisierung/#prices), [Dropscan](https://www.dropscan.de/preise/privat)
- even name aliasing possible for post without legal requirements (e.g. marketing mail)
- automated scanning also very practical digital mail management
- still cannot be used for all post e.g. tax confirmations
- plans for businesses available, then e.g. valid for imprint use

[**"Nachsendeservice"** by Deutsche Post](https://www.deutschepost.de/de/n/nachsendeservice.html)
- explicitly forbids use for address anonymization and can anyways only be used for 6 months max

### Phone

### Email

### Web

#### Browser 6 search

#### VPN

#### DNS

### Password

### Payment

### Device

#### Mobile

- Privacy control (e.g. app permissons) and security (e.g. sandboxing) better on iOS/Android compared to desktop

#### Desktop

## Backups: general tips

### 3-2-1 backup method

- **3x copies**: primary working copy + 2 backups
- **2x storage media**: e.g. local disk + cloud
- **1x offsite** e.g. external drive or cloud
