## Dangers of neglecting tech security & privacy

### Security
- direct theft of money
- identity theft
  - invoicing purchases to you
  - decreased credit rating
  - account access frozen (payment, other services...)
  - reputational damage
    - crime in ones name
    - sensitive data leaks
    - private professional brand/trust damage
  - exhausting legal battles & doxing/harassment
  - feeling of violation & living in anxiety of attacks yet to happen
- legal (compliance) consequences in case of major neglect
- blackmail & ransom attacks

### Privacy
- contract rejection (medical records, car accidents...)
- deepfake attacks on family
- burglary, cyberstalking etc.

## Security & privacy in general

### Compartmentalization

- separating data of any kind for different purposes, e.g.
  - work/job
  - personal professional (e.g. personal brand, business, LinkedIn)
  - personal private (e.g. family and friends)
  - personal public (e.g. social, dating, shopping)
  - perosnal sensitive (e.g. health, finance, civil)
- when/where? can be done in most areas, from email over user profiles to even addresses
- benefits
  - organization
  - security: isolation
  - privacy: limiting the potentially exponential value increase of correlating your data across situations

### Pseudonyms

- your "alter egos" for different situations, though one is sufficient for most cases/people
- pseudonym should have own set of all data typically required for registration/contact purposes
  - address
  - birthday
  - phone
  - email
  - credit card
- depending on situation the contact data can be entirely fake or actually forward to you anonymously
- proving plausible fake information has benefit of
  - drawing less attention/suspicion than outright hiding data
  - making profiling harder by producing incoherent data

### Data cleanup

- When in doubt consider that the internet never forgets
- non-EU and especially are noticably more clingy with your data
- Overwriting (sensitive) data with junk is better than removal in many cases
  - given it's often legally sufficient to mark data as "deactivated" rathen then deleting it 
- [Ingocni](https://incogni.com/)
  - maybe try for 1 month for 80% of effect
- [JustDeleteMe](https://justdeleteme.xyz/)
  - check before account creation how "clingy" the company is

### US vs EU: paid options vs laws

- US has more advanced privacy service like [MySudo](https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/)
  - EU has stronger privacy laws that make
    - fewer options less of an issue
    - more extreme methods like SIMless phone less necessary

## Security & privacy per topic

### Address/post

Caveats
- legal requirements for a physical address ("ladungsf√§hig") in certain cases like business mail
  - operating e.g. own blog or business without this can get you fined

### Phone number

#### Security
- phone numbers are not only security relevant indirectly via communiction (see social engineering) but nowadays also directly e.g. in 2FA
  - e.g. in Germany especially critical services like bank, health insurance like to only offer SIM 2FA without alternative
  - SIM hijacking is hard to defend against as fraudsters often use attack vectors out of the users control, like SIM provider customer support
    - depending on the attack (and e.g. personal use of the SIM), a SIM transfer is hard to notice just by absence of incoming calls/SMS
  - phone numbers can often be considered as significant proof of identity, thus can play a role in identity theft
    - your voicemail can be enough to clone your voice for an AI to impersonate you    
- phone calls an SMS are inherently insecure because unencrypted, making eavesdropping trivial given certain hardware
  - treat them like public conversations

#### Privacy
- Mobile network providers can track your location accurately via cell phone tower triangulation while identifying your via your SIM IMEI
  - e.g. in US network providers routinely sell this information
- SIM cards actually funtion as small individual computers, using the phones hardware but bypassing the software (e.g. VPNs -> split tunneling) [^SIMcomputer]
- not all countries allow anonymous SIM purchase
- dedicated privacy measures probably not necessary in EU thanks to data protection laws

[^SIMcomputer]: https://youtu.be/RyirQOCUUK8?feature=shared&t=156

#### Mitigation

- airplane mode will prevent location tracking but only SIM removal will stop the SIM doing anything on its own
- use encrypted messengers like [Signal](https://signal.org/) for both text and calls
- deactivate voicemail to prevent voice cloning
- harden your provider account to prevent SIM hijacking
- Compartementalization
  - Having e.g. 5 phone numbers is feasible nowadays
    - pre paid is often sufficient as mainly the number is needed, wifi can handle communication just fine 
    - eSIMs can't all be active at the same time but still be switched and are harder to steal

### Email

### Web

#### Browser 6 search

#### VPN

#### DNS

### Password

### Payment

### Device

#### Mobile

- Privacy control (e.g. app permissons) and security (e.g. sandboxing) better on iOS/Android compared to desktop

#### Desktop

## Backups: general tips

### 3-2-1 backup method

- **3x copies**: primary working copy + 2 backups
- **2x storage media**: e.g. local disk + cloud
- **1x offsite** e.g. external drive or cloud
