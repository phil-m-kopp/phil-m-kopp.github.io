- Build your knowledge and skills effectively and efficiently

<!--more-->

### Sources

- **Learning from others**
  - **Menteeship**
  - **Social/networking**
  - **Idols**
- **books: book summaries**
- **book vs course vs coach**
- **introspection**
  - **retros**


### Methods

- **Learning with others**: study groups, forums, and collaborative projects
- **Deliberate practice**: "While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance."
- **Tight feedback loops**

- **Growth mindset**

- **Learn on the go**
- **Iteration**

### Persist / Enhance

- *Knowledge sharing**
  - **Mentorship**
  - **Write**

- **Knowledge management**
  - **Second brain**
  - **Spaced repetition**: The brain learns better when information is spaced out over time rather than crammed all at once. Spaced repetition, which involves reviewing material at increasing intervals, reinforces memory retention by engaging with information at optimal intervals for memory consolidation.
  - **Apply/connect knowledge**

- **Sleep**: Quality sleep is crucial for memory consolidation. During sleep, the brain processes and stores newly acquired information, facilitating learning and memory retention.
- **Emotional engagement**: Emotions play a significant role in memory formation. Strong emotional connections to information can enhance its retention. Making learning personally meaningful or attaching emotions to the material can aid in memory recall.
- **Active recall**: Actively retrieving information from memory through practices like self-quizzing or summarizing information without looking at the source material strengthens memory recall. This strategy taps into the brain's ability to strengthen neural connections through active engagement.
- **Multisensory learning**: Engaging multiple senses (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) while learning enhances memory retention. For instance, combining reading with visual aids or hands-on activities reinforces learning by activating different areas of the brain.
