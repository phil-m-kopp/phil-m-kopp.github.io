## Motivation
- fatty liver: simple calories deficit doesn't help -> deep ketosis e.g. through fasting necessary [^fattyliver]
- experience how (benefits from) deep ketosis & autophagy feel
- reset salt, sweetness, insulin and food volume desensentivation
- get a bit leaner

## Prep
- Laxative: Glauber salt (~5€ at the pharmacy)
- Tea
  - Digestion / Detox
    - Dandelion "Löwenzahn"
    - Nettle "Brenessel"
    - Apple vinegar: mild, low in calories and inhibits insulin spike
  - Flavor: whatever you like
- Supplements
  - Vitamins: [^vitamins]
  - Electrolytes, especially Magnesium & Potassium "Kalium" [^electrolytes]
- Food
  - Soup veggies, e.g. 400g / 2 days
  - Veggie broth
  - Erythritol and stevia: two of the few zero calories sugar substitutes that don't lead to insulin spikes and are not known to impact gut health and thus e.g. insulin resistance [^fattyliver]
- Equipment
  - Hot water bottle / grain pillow etc.: to calm the stomach
  - optional tracking
    - Body scale
    - Heart rate monitor (e.g. watch, to enable monitoring during sleep)
    - Blood pressure monitor
    - Continuous glucose monitor [^cgm]

## To avoid
- Portions with calories >10-20kcal
  - Will not only inhibit autophagy & ketosis, but can also lead to insulin spike and thus hunger
- Any food with intense flavor, e.g. also coffee

## Daily routine
- 2-3l Water 
  - Veggie soup:  
    - boil 400g veggies in 1L for 40-60min 
    - Strain liquid from veggies 
    - Add as little salt as possible, up to 6g 
    - Compensate evaporated water up to 2l again 
  - Teas 
    - 1x bag Dandelion + 1x Nettle per day to support detox
- Supplements 
  - As described
- Training
  - Strength training to prevent muscle loss
  - At least 5k - 10k steps to support digestion and counter metabolic adaption

## The plan

### 2 weeks before 
- Get used to eating less 
- Order prep stuff 

### 1 week before 
- Reduce calories down to 500-1000kcal till last day before  
- Not much fiber the day before, e.g. only curd, yoghurt etc. 

### Day 1 
- Glaubersalz 30g 500ml in <15min
- Cardio to exhaust carbs

### Day 2-4 
- Prepare for crisis
  - Lay down

### Day 5
- Vacation day for rest

## My actual experience

### Energy/Endurance

> - How easy it was to exercise or even move (motivation wise)
> - Low energy levels make prolonged cardio in particular very hard and lead to higher heart rate at same output
> - Low energy doesn't mean potential strength output is low, but it get's very uncomfortable and requires a lot of discipline
> - Low energy levels are maybe the main factor that make fasting feel hard to endure, especially if you need to stay productive and active

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Energy" [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4]
    bar "Energy" [5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4]
```

- Personally the hardest part for me about fasting was knowing that skipping strength training would mean sacrificing hard earned muscle at a potentially fast rate and thus needing to find the motivation for daily training as much as before - while fighting against increasing discomfort to finish sets strong and later even starting sets at all
- When energy hit a new low on day 8 (Saturday) and going shopping (or at least the thought of it) felt like hiking uphill, I decided that considering needed buffer/ramp up for recovery I should rather start eating again to be fit for work next week
  - same as the days before, after ~10-30min of walking/activity: energy levels actually recovered noticeable and the activity didn't feel so uncomfortable anymore after building some momentum
  - this again showed that activity wasn't impossible, but rather the body just "strongly discouraged" activity to conserve energy
- Even after eating normally again, especially during training (gymnastics) I noticed energy wasn't back to the levels before

## Power/strength output

> - Maximum strength set volume output during strength training compared to before
> - Lower power levels mean maximum set volume was lower even at maximum discipline  

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Power" [5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    bar "Power" [5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```

- As expected, maximum set volume almost didn't suffer at all except maybe on the worst days and during exercises with more pronounced endurance component (e.g. L-sits)
- On day 11 I even set a new personal record, increasing my handstand-against-wall time from 120 to 240 seconds
- Even after eating normally again, especially during training (gymnastics) I noticed energy wasn't back to the levels before

## Dizzy

> - Dizziness while standing but also sitting as well as "brain fog"
> - Inhibited mental work similarly as low motivation

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Dizzy" [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]
    bar "Dizzy" [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]
```
- The dizziness was comparable to what I feel during a fever
- Especially combined with mental fatigue in the late afternoon this was impacting concentration required for mental work
- Balance during exercise wasn't impacted noticeably
- Luckily the dizziness mostly came in spikes and I barely noticed them longer than 30min at a time

## Mood

> - General mood, e.g. considering feelings of sadness and irritability

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Mood" [5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4]
    bar "Mood" [5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4]
```

- More than anything, mood seemed mostly related to cravings and e.g. not being able to do cooking as a hobby

## Motivation

> - Motivation to be productive and active
> - Low motivation will lead to e.g. excessive doom scrolling and make non-intrinsically motivated (mental) work quite hard to keep up

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Motivation" [5, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4]
    bar "Motivation" [5, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4]
```

- I really needed day 5 as a vacation day to recover some motivation - not sure I'd have managed without it and not appearing like a slacker at work

## Hunger

> - Feeling of hunger as in actually needing to eat, as e.g. indicated by stomach growling

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Hunger" [2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3]
    bar "Hunger" [2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3]
```

- As expected, probably keeping insulin very low at all times by staying at almost zero with calories helped with keeping hunger in check so that it was only a minor inconvenience - pretty unimportant e.g. compared to lower energy levels

## Craving

> - Simply "wanting to eat" or tasting something flavorful independent of a feeling of needing to eat

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Craving" [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 3]
    bar "Craving" [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 3]
```

- Here I really failed the idea of fasting to avoid intense flavors, especially sweetness and salt
- On day 2 I began to use more erythritol and stevia tabs e.g. in my tea, where I think especially the erythritol but maybe also the carriers ingredients in the stevia tabs lead to regular bubbling in my stomach, though e.g. not uncontrolled diarrhea or gassing
- On day 4 I bought some artificially sweetened lozenges
- On day 5 I switched out some tee with heavily diluted (20 kCal) DIY hot chocolate
- On day 6 I increased the sweetened consumption yet again, making it hard to fall and stay asleep
- Before going into calory surplus on day 11, I still felt strong cravings at intake levels that should have been around maintenance level (and I didn't feel hungry)

## Pain

> - Any kind of kind which seems directly related to fasting
> - Stomach (region) pain is probably most common (as it was more me), but e.g. muscle aching due to limited regeneration could also be considerd here
> - This excludes e.g. non-painful bubbling in stomach

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Pain" [1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    bar "Pain" [1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

- I felt both pain spikes (day 3 + 6) from somewhere in lower liver region
- They were sharp enough to prevent me walking with a straight spine - - The 1st spike I could resolve by laying down for 3min, which seemed to get some water out of a spot where it didn't belong especially during sitting it seemed
- The 2nd one was even sharper but went away quickly after a toilet break and without needing to lay down
- Interestingly, binging 1600 kCal at day 8 6pm in 3-4h only caused me only minor issues. I started off again with a veggie puree made of veggie soup liquid remains and frozen veggie soup "leftovers", which caused a minor and short discomfort in the stomach. After that my stomach didn't complain much, though I also tried to keep volume in check with higher calory food like soy bean flakes

## Sleep quality

> - Perceived sleep quality of that night going into the next morning

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar [5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2]
    bar [5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 2]
```

- Beyond the first days where hunger was still noticeable, sleep quality later mainly deteriorated due to increased consumption of sweetened drinks
- but also late night walks I tried to cram in before sleep to counteract not moving enough during the day

## Sleepy

> - Feeling of sleepiness, without differentiation whether caused by low energy levels or poor sleep quality

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "1 to 5 (highest)" 1 --> 5

    bar "Sleepy" [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3]
    bar "Sleepy" [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3]
```

- Unsurprisingly, sleepiness increased with decreasing sleep quality and I feel this was the main factor here, even considering decreasing energy levels

## Weight

> - Measured after getting up, going to the toilet, in underwear only
> - Weight differences should always be evaluated carefully and rather averaged across no less than a week, e.g. considering that muscles in the average person can store ~2kg of water and drinking 2-4l daily during fasting is recommended
> - Rather, consider that 1kg of body-fat can provide 7000 kCal, so assuming e.g. a 1500 kCal deficit should result ~200g fat loss per day
> - Anything beyond that must largely be water based differences to happen so quickly 

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "kg"

    bar [66.4, 66.1, 65.5, 65.2, 65.2, 64.7, 63.9, 63.2, 62.8, 62.8, 63.4, 64.1]
    bar [66.4, 66.1, 65.5, 65.2, 65.2, 64.7, 63.9, 63.2, 62.8, 62.8, 63.4, 64.1]
```

## Resting heart rate

> - Measured by Huawei Watch Fit 3

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "bpm" 30 --> 51

    bar [51, 45, 48, 37, 38, 37, 37, 47, 43, 47, 45, 49]
    bar [51, 45, 48, 37, 38, 37, 37, 47, 43, 47, 45, 49]
```

- The very low RHRs were usually measured during sleep of course

## Calories intake

> - Total kCal intake, incl. e.g. supplements

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "kCal"

    bar [1000, 20, 20, 20, 20, 80, 80, 140, 1500, 1800, 1800, 2400]
    bar [1000, 20, 20, 20, 20, 80, 80, 140, 1500, 1800, 1800, 2400]
```

- Due to cravings I also starting adding diluted hot chocolate to the menu from day 5 (on top of ~20kCal from supplements)
- After eating again normally on day 8 - 10, I wanted to set a signal of "there's enough food, provide energy pls" to my body (and also address constant cravings honestly) on day 11

## Water intake

> - Rather accurate during fasting, else estimated intake through raw liquids + food water content

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "ml" 0 --> 3600

    bar [2000, 2400, 2400, 2400, 2000, 2400, 3000, 3600, 1700, 2000, 2000, 2000]
    bar [2000, 2400, 2400, 2400, 2000, 2400, 3000, 3600, 1700, 2000, 2000, 2000]
```

- Due to cravings, I consumed more sweetened tea and hot chocolate from day 6

## Blood pressure

> - Measured by Omron RS7 Intelli IT
> - Sys on top, Dia below

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "mmHg"

    line "Sys" [99, 98, 94, 100, 99, 97, 101, 99, 91, 94, 97, 93]
    line "Sys" [99, 98, 94, 100, 99, 97, 101, 99, 91, 94, 97, 93]
    line "Dia" [66, 61, 59, 65, 69, 64, 68, 63, 55, 64, 58, 60]
```

- Even though I exercise a lot, I guess due to low body weight my blood pressure is generally low, giving me not a lot of buffer before other circumstances that lower pressure even further lead noticeable dizziness
- Blood pressure seemed fine though until I started to get short black outs on day 7 and then especially day 8 when trying to stand up from sitting too quickly. I didn't want to get to a place were there was a risk of collapsing while standing, so I took this as a sign to quit the fasting

## Stress / HRV

> - Proxy of heart rate variability 
> - Measured by Huawei Watch Fit 3

``` mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis "Day" 0 --> 11
    y-axis "Value" 0 --> 31

    bar [33, 24, 26, 23, 28, 21, 23, 27, 29, 26, 31, 32]
    bar [33, 24, 26, 23, 28, 21, 23, 27, 29, 26, 31, 32]
```

- Doesn't tell me much, other than it seemed to decrease during fasting and then increased again 

## Other

- KFA: 6.5mm -> 5.5mm
- Temp felt 2-4°C less

## Learnings
- Potentially went into an electrolyte deficit due to reading the label wrong 
  - the supplement only provided 15% of recommended daily Potassium and 40% Magnesium
  - on the one hand I took at least 10g of added salt per day and the daily 1L of veggie soup is also intended provide electrolytes
  - on the other hand on the later days the 4L of liquid intake also lead to constant liquid and electrolyte on the toilet

## Q&A
- Caffeine?
  - Can potentially help with ketosis 
- Protein? 
  - Only 1 curd cheese with 30g possible anyways 
  - Deep ketosis probably better
- Buchinger method?
  - Focus on veggie soup (only liquid) and diluted veggie/fruit juice (up to 200kcal per day) as compromise between low carb/calories and avoiding vitamin/mineral supplements
  - Focus is not only on autophagy & ketosis but also learning to appreciate and be conscious about food again
- Why
