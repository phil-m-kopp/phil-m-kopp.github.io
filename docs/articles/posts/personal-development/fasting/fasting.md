- How and why this website came to be

## Motivation
- fatty liver: simple calories deficit doesn't help -> deep ketosis e.g. through fasting necessary [^fattyliver]
- experience how (benefits from) deep ketosis & autophagy feel
- reset salt, sweetness and insulin sensitivity

## Prep
- Laxative: Glauber salt (~5€ at the pharmacy)
- Tea
  - Digestion / Detox
    - Dandelion "Löwenzahn"
    - Nettle "Brenessel"
    - Apple vinegar: mild, low in calories and inhibits insulin spike
  - Flavour: whatever you like
- Supplements
  - Vitamins: [^vitamins]
  - Electrolytes, especially Magnesium & Potassium "Kalium" [^electrolytes]
- Food
  - Soup veggies, e.g. 400g / 2 days
  - Veggie broth
- Equipment
  - Hot water bottle / grain pillow etc.: to calm the stomach
  - optinal tracking
    - Body scale
    - Heart rate monitor (e.g. watch, to enable monitoring during sleep)
    - Blood pressure monitor
    - Continuous glucose monitor [^cgm]

## To avoid
- Portions with calories >10-20kcal
  - Will not only inhibit autophagy & ketosis, but can also lead to insulin spike and thus hunger
- Any food with intense flavor, e.g. also coffee

## Daily routine
- 2-3l Water 
  - Veggie soup:  
    - boil 400g veggies in 1L for 40-60min 
    - Strain liquid from veggies 
    - Add as little salt as possible, up to 6g 
    - Compensate evaporated water up to 2l again 
  - Teas 
    - 1x bag Dandelion + 1x Nettle per day to support detox
- Supplements 
  - As described
- Training
  - Strength training to prevent muscle loss
  - At least 5k - 10k steps to support digestion and counter metabolic adaption

## Timeline

### 2 weeks before 
- Get used to eating less 
- Order prep stuff 

### 1 week before 
- Reduce calories down to 500-1000kcal till last day before  
- Not much fiber the day before, e.g. only curd, yoghurt etc. 

### Day 1 
    Glaubersalz 30g 500ml in <15min 
Day 2-4 
    Prepare for crisis 
        Lay down 

## Q&A
- Coffein?
  - Can potentially help with ketosis 
- Protein? 
  - Only 1 curd cheese with 30g possible anyways 
  - Deep ketosis probably better
- Buchinger method?
  - Focus on veggie soup (only liquid) and diluted veggie/fruit juice (up to 200kcal per day) as compromise between low carb/calories and avoiding vitamin/mineral supplements
  - Focus is not only on autophagy & ketosis but also learning to appreciate and be concious about food again
