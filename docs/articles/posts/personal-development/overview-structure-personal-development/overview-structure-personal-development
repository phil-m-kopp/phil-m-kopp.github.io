## Goals & Habits

- Personal goals:
  - fitness & mental health
    - exercise: a primary driver of happiness through injury prevention and serotonin
      - strength: low-to-medium-reps resistance/weight training in the gym or e.g. as calisthenics/body-weight-training at home. After mobility also contributes greatly to pain and injury prevention, e.g. fixing back pain for office workers.
      - endurance: e.g. HIIT or ideally as part of ones regularly practiced main sport (e.g. Gymnastics for me), as relative health benefits are actually greatest at moderate intensity. Promotes good health at old age through training the cardiovascular and locomotor system and prevents feeling tired and of course overweight. Tip: light cardio in the evening (>2-3h before bed) can help sleep and makes it less tempting to eat what you just burned to actually loose weight
      - mobility: e.g. Yoga or other routine focusing on joint mobility and dynamic stretching (better long-term than static stretching) + being mindful about proper posture. Progress here is rarely "flashy", but has the broadest range of benefits as it supports strength, endurance, everyday life tasks and most importantly pain & injury prevention especially at old age.
    - mindfulness
      - acceptance/non-judgemental
      - mindful eating/walking: Pay full attention to the sensory experience of eating / movement and surroundings without distractions.
      - Power of now: stay in the present
    - meditation
      - box breathing
      - body scan: Practice focusing attention on different parts of the body, relaxing each part consciously
    - sleep hygiene: quality sleep is indispensable for physical and mental help as well as enabling consistently high productivity
      - sleep/wake same times
      - 10-3-2-1-0 rule - avoid before sleep: caffeine 10h, food/drinks 3h, work/exercise 2h, screens 1h + 0x times snoozing in the morning
    - positive thinking
      - Random Acts of Kindness: Perform small, unexpected acts of kindness to positively impact others' lives.
      - positive reinforcement/affirmations or lofty questions
      - Duchenne smile: e.g. in bed nobody sees it, but you feel it
      - gratitude: Regularly write down or verbalize things you're grateful for to cultivate a positive mindset.
    - Invest in relationships:
      - solid, supportive and positive relationships are a primary driver of happiness through serotonin (even for introverts)
      - Famously one of the regrets of the dying: neglecting relationships [^dyingregrets]
    - Delay gratification: often indulging in instant gratification, so without e.g. hard work to justify it, will mess your dopamine system and thus lower the excitement life gives you in general (luckily it resets after a while)
    - Healthy eating:
      - Hydration and Nutrition Tracking: track calories/macros and water intake e.g. once a month to recalibrate bad habits
      - Cut and don't add sweets and salt: the daily recommended intakes of sugar (25-50g) and especially salt (6g) are easily exceeded even if you mostly avoid processed foods [^salty]. Both sugar (insulin) and salt (thirst) make you tired and effectively drive you eat even more. Best (partial!) replacements for sugar are Erythritol  [^eri] or Stevia (though even they promote cravings and can impact gut health, research pending...) and spice mixes or MSG (myth: unhealthy [^msg] for salt
      - Intermitted fasting: e.g. the typical 18h-6h method (fasting then eating) helps improve fat-burning, recalibrating your hunger and prevents mindless snacking, which would drive hunger through insulin and can e.g. impact sleep quality in the evening
      - Don't drink your calories: liquids (e.g. fruit juice, coconut milk, alcohol, oils) can have >5-10x times higher calory counts per volume compared to solid foods (e.g. apple juice vs whole apples), making it a primary driver of "overeating" if not watched out for
  - social & romantic relationships
    - emotional intelligence
      - active listening: Practice giving full attention when communicating with others, seeking to understand before being understood.
      - XYZ conflict resolution: express your feelings, state your needs, propose solutions
    - hell yeah or no
    - emotional control
      - never decide while angry
  - business & career
    - time management
      - prioritization
        - Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance, focusing on what's truly significant.
      - productive procrastination
      - Time Blocking: Allocate specific blocks of time for different tasks or activities to manage and maximize productivity.
      - Pomodoro: Work in focused intervals (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by short breaks to enhance productivity.
      - Getting Things Done (GTD) Method: Organize tasks into actionable items, projects, and next steps for effective task management.
      - Time tracking
    - Motivation:
      - Goal visualization: Have a concrete and vividly positive image of your goal in mind or even physically around  
      - (Small) Next steps: Having the very next steps laid out in small junks makes it easy to start
      - Motivation comes from action
      - Adaptive Thinking: Embrace change by reframing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning.
    - reflection/retros
    - growth mindset & deliberate practice
      - Feedback: Actively seek feedback from peers, mentors, or colleagues to identify areas for growth.
    - Support network: you are the average of the people around you
      - Peer: who understands you and your challenges
      - Coach: asking the hard questions and challenges you
      - Mentor: has the experience to give advice
    - Networking
      - Diverse network: network out of social/work circle 
    - Personal branding
      - have a clear pitch
      - share knowledge
    - finances
      - (automated) budgeting: use software to track expenses
      - (passive) investing: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and long-term financial goals.
        - emergency savings
        - emotional resilience
        - ETF investing
      - automatic saving
      - renting vs buying
      - financial literacy: even more than knowing what to do, it's crucial especially for investing what not to do as greed, fear and irrational, emotionally driven impulsive behavior is one of the most important factors in bad financial situations
    - knowledge building
      - book summaries
      - spaced repetition
      - second brain
      - mentoring: mentor others to solidify your own understand and gain new perspectives
    - skills
      - deliberate practice: don't just practice regular and often, but reflect on your progress 
      - learn with mentors: learn better with an experienced mentor who guides your learning
  - habit building
    - 2-day rule: never skip 2 days in a row
    - consistency over quantity: better drop workout to 5min than to skip it for the day
    - habit stacking: E.g. be mindful when brushing your teeth so that momentum from one also benefits the other

  [^salty]: e.g. even otherwise quiet healthy food like gherkins, German harz cheese or veggie brooth can get you over >10g salt quickly
