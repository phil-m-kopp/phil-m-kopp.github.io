### Doctors

- Dentist:
  - Set up check-ups (reminders) 2x a year 
  - In Germany, if you visit the denist for a routine check-up at least 1x a year, an additional 10% is paid by health insurance after 5 years, 15% after 10 years. Considering dentist operations can start to cost >1000€ beyond age 30-40, this habit can be worth a lot 
- Vaccination:
  - Some vaccinations e.g. against the flu, corona or local sicknesses like FSME (Bavaria) are only effective for a limited time and need to be refreshed potentially yearly
- Preventive check-ups [^preventive]:
  - Especially from 30 (women) / 35 (men) years onwards (and every 5-10 years after that), there's a list of preventive check-ups e.g. for kidney and cardiovascular diseases, diabetis and breast/prostate/skin etc. cancer that are recommended to be done every 1-3 years
  - Health insurance usually not only covers them, but might also pay a bonus or extras for doing the check-ups
  - Check which new check-ups now apply to use and set up new calendar reminders

### Finance

- Contracts:
  - Service & price: use online contract comparison sites[^contractsW] or magazines[^contractsM] to check if you improve running contracts
  - Need: check if still needed
  - Replace with service: check if service could be worth it / cheaper, e.g. if you do something regularly
  - Set up reminders to check contracts again or cancel before end of the notice period, e.g. 1.5 months before
  - Insurance:
    - Third party liability / "Haftpflichtversicherung"
    - Health insurance
    - As needed: car, travel, pet, household, life, teeth, accident, disability, legal 
  - Subscriptions:
    - Netflix, AmazonPrime, Hulu, Apple Music, Spotify etc.
    - Other web services, e.g. cloud storage, game passes etc.
    - Books, magazines, journals, newspapers etc.
    - Gym, sports club, fitness apps etc.
    - Interest, alumni etc. groups and clubs
    - Food delivery etc.

### House

- Security:
  - Burglary protection: check if still adequate, e.g. after moving, new expensive stuff etc.
  - IT:
    - Smartphone and other mobile devices: 
      - the risk: 
        - huge collection of private and sensitive data in an easy to lose package
        - often also used for MFA via authenticator apps or SMS: you not only loose access yourself but worst case your MFA is also compromised
      - read up on state of the art security methods
- Safety
  - Fire extinguisher: check pressure, refill/replace if needed
  - Fire sources:
    - Old or damaged eletronics & batteries: dispose e.g. if cable insulation open, water heater etc. sometimes not turning off again by itself, recharchable battery toy getting warm while charging ...
    - New/moved stuff: the amount of electrical devices at home usually only increases and you should look out for clustering of devices, overloaded multi-plugs and proximity to flammable materials (overloaded multi-plug behind couch is not ideal)
